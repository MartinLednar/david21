# About this project
My first big project, that I've made after taking the [Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/).
This website was made for my good friend and talented musician David21. It's an e-shop with his great music. You can find live website here: https://david-21.herokuapp.com/.
